# html-sass-js-template

Basic front-end template.

Use this command to watch changes in .scss files and generate/update CSS file (SASS compiler must be installed):
  cmd: "sass --watch sass:css"

Color themes can be modified and/or extended in '_themes.scss'.

Colors are compiled as css properties, so that they can be easily targeted with JavaScript if needed.
